 # Component Structure Rules

These rules apply to all React components in the `components/` directory.

## Component Organization
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `TodoList.tsx`)
- One component per file
- Components should be functionally pure when possible
- Export components as named exports

## Documentation
- Include JSDoc comments for component documentation
```typescript
/**
 * Component description
 * @param {ComponentProps} props - Component props description
 * @returns {JSX.Element} Component description
 */
```

## Chakra UI Usage
- Use Chakra UI components and styling system
- Follow Chakra's component composition patterns
- Utilize Chakra's theme system for consistent styling
- Maintain responsive design patterns using Chakra's responsive syntax
```typescript
<Box
  width={{ base: "100%", md: "50%", lg: "33%" }}
  padding={[2, 4, 6]}
>
```

## Component Best Practices
- Components should be modular and reusable
- Implement proper prop validation
- Use proper React hooks patterns
- Maintain consistent error boundary implementation
- Follow established naming conventions throughout

## Performance Considerations
- Implement proper memoization where needed
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use proper lazy loading patterns
- Keep components focused and minimal
