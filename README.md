Source code of my personal website. I decided to update my website in 2021 because:

1. It's COVID, gotta take on a new hobby
2. As a challenge, can I still build a damn website after 5+ years of being an EM?

If you really want a blast from the past, check out my [old website](https://old.jessechen.net/) from the early 2010's ðŸ˜±

## Overview

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). Best frontend tech stack for yet-another-dev-website, don't @ me.

To build: `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and then go to http://localhost:3000/.

The website is pretty straightforward:

- `pages/` is where the various webpages are
- `posts/` is where my raw blog posts go (written in .mdx format)
- `components/` contains the various UI components seen across the site
