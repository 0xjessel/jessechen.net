# MDX Content Rules

These rules apply to all MDX content files in the `posts/` directory.

## File Organization
- All blog posts must be organized by year in `posts/YYYY/` directory
- Follow the naming convention: `title-here.mdx`

## Frontmatter Requirements
Every MDX file must include the following frontmatter:
```md
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Post description"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
isPublished: boolean
tags: string[]
coverImage: string
---
```

## Image Handling
- Image paths must follow format: `/images/posts/YYYY/image-name.png`
- All images must be placed in corresponding `public/images/posts/YYYY/` directory
- Images should be optimized before adding to the repository

## Content Formatting
- Content must be written in MDX format with proper markdown syntax
- Code blocks must specify language for syntax highlighting
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)

## Code Examples
- Code examples in MDX blog posts are for demonstration purposes only
- Do NOT modify code examples in blog posts during dependency updates or refactoring
- Code examples may intentionally show older syntax/patterns for educational purposes
- If a code example needs updating, create a new blog post or add a note below the example

## Validation
Before committing any MDX content, ensure:
1. All required frontmatter fields are present
2. All image paths are valid and images exist
3. Code blocks have language specifications
4. Content renders properly in development environment
