# NPM Package Upgrade Guide

This document outlines the process, findings, and challenges related to updating npm packages in the jessechen.net project.

## Upgrade Strategy

The upgrade process has been organized into three groups, ordered from least to most risky:

### Group 3: Utility Tools

- ✅ remark-slug v7 → rehype-slug (latest)
- ✅ eslint v8 → v9 (requires eslint-config-next v15)

### Group 2: UI Libraries

- ❌ @chakra-ui/react v2 → v3 (attempted but reverted due to compatibility issues)
- ❌ framer-motion v11 → v12 (reverted along with Chakra UI)

### Group 1: Next.js Ecosystem

- ✅ next v14 → v15
- ✅ eslint-config-next v14 → v15
- ✅ react v18 → v19 (optional, Next.js 15 supports both v18 and v19)

## Migration Details

### Group 1: Next.js Ecosystem Migration

The Next.js ecosystem migration was completed successfully. Key steps included:

1. **Package Updates**:

   - Upgraded Next.js from v14.2.5 to the latest v15.x
   - Upgraded eslint-config-next from v14.2.5 to the latest v15.x
   - Upgraded React and React DOM from v18.3.1 to the latest v19.x

2. **Code Changes**:
   - Updated the Link API implementation across the codebase to remove deprecated `passHref` and `legacyBehavior` props
   - Updated imports from `NextLink` to `Link` throughout the codebase
   - No changes were required for MDX processing as next-mdx-remote was already at a compatible version

Detailed documentation of the migration process is available in [llm-docs/next15-migration.mdx](llm-docs/next15-migration.mdx).

### Group 2: UI Libraries Migration Attempt

The attempt to upgrade Chakra UI from v2 to v3 and framer-motion from v11 to v12 encountered significant compatibility issues, leading to a rollback. Key findings:

1. **Package Updates Attempted**:

   - Attempted to upgrade @chakra-ui/react from v2.10.6 to v3.8.1
   - Attempted to upgrade framer-motion from v11.18.2 to v12

2. **Encountered Issues**:

   - Multiple theme-related errors emerged after upgrading to Chakra UI v3:

     - `TypeError: extendBaseTheme is not a function`
     - `TypeError: defineStyleConfig is not a function`
     - `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_config')`

   - These errors indicated significant breaking changes in Chakra UI's theming API between v2 and v3

3. **Resolution**:

   - Rolled back to @chakra-ui/react@2.8.2 and framer-motion@11.3.28
   - Used the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve dependency conflicts with React 19
   - Restored the original theme configuration using v2 APIs like `extendTheme` and `mode` functions

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Upgrading to Chakra UI v3 would require a significant refactoring of the theme configuration
   - The cost-benefit analysis favored staying on Chakra UI v2 for the time being

### Group 3: Utility Tools Migration

The ESLint upgrade from v8 to v9 was completed successfully after first updating Next.js and eslint-config-next to v15. Key steps included:

1. **Package Updates**:

   - Upgraded Next.js from v14.2.5 to v15.2.0
   - Upgraded eslint-config-next from v14.2.5 to v15.2.0
   - Upgraded ESLint from v8.57.1 to v9.21.0

2. **Findings**:
   - ESLint v9 is not compatible with eslint-config-next v14.x
   - The update to Next.js v15 and eslint-config-next v15 needed to be completed first
   - After updating to eslint-config-next v15, the ESLint v9 upgrade worked without issues

## Findings and Insights

### Dependency Interdependencies

One of the key challenges with updating packages is managing interdependencies. Notable examples:

1. **ESLint and eslint-config-next**: ESLint v9 is only compatible with eslint-config-next v15+. Attempting to use ESLint v9 with eslint-config-next v14 results in dependency conflicts.

2. **Next.js Peer Dependencies**: Next.js v15 has the following peer dependencies:

   ```json
   {
     "sass": "^1.3.0",
     "react": "^18.2.0 || 19.0.0-rc-de68d2f4-20241204 || ^19.0.0",
     "react-dom": "^18.2.0 || 19.0.0-rc-de68d2f4-20241204 || ^19.0.0",
     "@playwright/test": "^1.41.2",
     "@opentelemetry/api": "^1.1.0",
     "babel-plugin-react-compiler": "*"
   }
   ```

   This shows that Next.js v15 is compatible with both React v18 and v19, giving flexibility for the upgrade path.

3. **Chakra UI Peer Dependencies**: Chakra UI v3 requires:

   ```json
   {
     "react": ">=18",
     "react-dom": ">=18",
     "@emotion/react": ">=11"
   }
   ```

   This confirms compatibility with both React v18 and v19.

4. **React 19 and Chakra UI v2 Compatibility**: While Chakra UI v2 wasn't officially designed for React 19, it can be made to work by using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation. This bypasses the strict peer dependency checks in npm.

### Package Deprecations

Some packages have been deprecated in favor of newer alternatives:

1. **remark-slug → rehype-slug**: The package remark-slug v8 was deprecated with a recommendation to use rehype-slug instead. This required code changes to:
   - Import the new package
   - Move the plugin from remarkPlugins to rehypePlugins in the MDX serialization

### Breaking API Changes

1. **Chakra UI v3 Theming API**: The upgrade attempt revealed significant changes to Chakra UI's theming API:
   - Functions like `extendTheme` have been replaced or modified
   - The theme tools module appears to have been restructured
   - The way theme components are configured has changed substantially

## Challenges and Solutions

### Incompatible Major Versions

Major version updates often include breaking changes. For example:

1. **ESLint v9**: Breaking changes required coordinated updates with eslint-config-next.

   - Solution: Wait to update ESLint along with eslint-config-next.

2. **Deprecated Packages**: When remark-slug was updated, we discovered it was deprecated.

   - Solution: Replace with the recommended alternative (rehype-slug) and update the code accordingly.

3. **Chakra UI v3**: Major breaking changes in the theming API caused multiple errors.
   - Solution: Rolled back to Chakra UI v2 as the benefits of upgrading didn't justify the extensive refactoring required.

### Next.js 15 Migration Challenges

1. **Link API Changes**: Next.js 15 removes support for the legacy Link API.

   - Solution: Update all Link components to use the modern API by removing `passHref` and `legacyBehavior` props.

2. **Hydration Errors**: After migrating to Next.js 15, we encountered hydration errors due to nested anchor tags. In Next.js 15, the Link component now renders as an `<a>` tag by default, causing invalid HTML when nested with ChakraLink components.

   - Solution: Replace nested Link and ChakraLink combinations with a single Link component using inline styles for the styling previously provided by ChakraLink.

3. **Peer Dependencies**: When upgrading to Next.js 15, peer dependency warnings appeared.
   - Solution: These warnings were acceptable since Next.js 15 supports both React 18 and React 19.

### React 19 and UI Library Compatibility

1. **Chakra UI v2 with React 19**: When downgrading from Chakra UI v3 back to v2, we encountered peer dependency conflicts with React 19.
   - Solution: Used the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to bypass strict peer dependency checks, allowing Chakra UI v2 to work with React 19.

## Best Practices for NPM Updates

From our experience updating this codebase, we've identified these best practices:

1. **Check Peer Dependencies**: Before updating a package, check its peer dependencies to understand what other packages might be affected.

2. **Update in Groups**: Group related packages together and update them as a unit.

3. **Start with Low-Risk Updates**: Begin with utility packages that have fewer dependencies and are less likely to affect core functionality.

4. **Test After Each Update**: Verify functionality after each group of updates before proceeding to the next.

5. **Check for Deprecations**: Look for deprecation warnings and follow recommended migration paths.

6. **Consult Migration Guides**: Review official migration guides for major version updates to understand potential breaking changes.

7. **Have a Rollback Plan**: Before making major updates, ensure you can roll back if necessary. Document the working versions so you can return to them if needed.

8. **Use Flags Judiciously**: Flags like `--legacy-peer-deps` can be useful for resolving immediate dependency issues, but be aware that they bypass important compatibility checks.

## Current Status and Recommendations

After completing multiple package upgrades and attempting others, the current recommendations are:

1. **Completed Upgrades**:

   - ✅ Next.js ecosystem (Next.js, eslint-config-next, React) upgraded to latest versions
   - ✅ ESLint upgraded from v8 to v9
   - ✅ remark-slug replaced with rehype-slug

2. **Postponed Upgrades**:

   - ❌ Chakra UI upgrade from v2 to v3 is postponed due to significant theming API changes
   - ❌ framer-motion upgrade is postponed to maintain compatibility with Chakra UI v2

3. **Future Considerations**:
   - Consider planning a dedicated effort to refactor the theme configuration to be compatible with Chakra UI v3
   - Monitor for any security issues in the current versions that might necessitate upgrades
   - Consider exploring alternative UI libraries if Chakra UI v2 becomes unsupported or problematic
