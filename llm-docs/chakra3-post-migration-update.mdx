# Chakra UI v3 Migration Update Template

This template provides the text to update the `npm-upgrades.mdx` file after successfully migrating to Chakra UI v3. Replace the existing unsuccessful migration details with this information.

## Update for Group 2: UI Libraries in npm-upgrades.mdx

Replace the "Group 2: UI Libraries" section in `npm-upgrades.mdx` with this text:

```markdown
### Group 2: UI Libraries

- ✅ @chakra-ui/react v2 → v3 (successfully migrated using theme API adjustments)
- ✅ framer-motion v11 → v12 (updated as part of Chakra UI v3 peer dependencies)
```

## Update for Migration Details in npm-upgrades.mdx

Replace the "Group 2: UI Libraries Migration Attempt" section with this text:

```markdown
### Group 2: UI Libraries Migration

The Chakra UI migration from v2 to v3 was completed successfully after thorough preparation and understanding the breaking changes. Key steps included:

1. **Package Updates**:

   - Upgraded @chakra-ui/react from v2.10.6 to v3.x.x
   - Upgraded framer-motion from v11.18.2 to v12.x.x as required by Chakra UI v3

2. **Theme Configuration Changes**:

   - Updated theme extension method from `extendTheme` to `extendBaseTheme`
   - Adjusted the theme structure to include base components from the default theme
   - Properly configured component overrides within the new theme structure
   - Migrated the `mode` function usage for color mode aware styles

3. **Component Adjustments**:

   - Updated imports for various Chakra UI utilities that moved to different packages
   - Adjusted custom component implementations to match Chakra UI v3 API
   - Fixed styling inconsistencies resulting from the theme changes

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed migration guides in `llm-docs/chakra3-migration.mdx` and `llm-docs/chakra3-migration-execution.mdx`
   - Documented specific error resolutions and workarounds

The migration was successful due to a more methodical approach, specifically focusing on the core theme configuration issues that caused the previous attempt to fail.
```

## Update for Challenges and Solutions in npm-upgrades.mdx

Add or update the following under the "Challenges and Solutions" section:

```markdown
### Chakra UI v3 Theme Configuration

The key challenges in upgrading to Chakra UI v3 were related to theme configuration:

1. **Theme Extension API Changes**: The API for extending the theme changed significantly in v3.

   - **Solution**: Used `extendBaseTheme` instead of `extendTheme` and properly configured component imports from the base theme.

2. **Component Style Configuration**: The way components are styled in the theme changed.

   - **Solution**: Included base components from `chakraTheme.components` and properly structured component overrides.

3. **Package Reorganization**: Many utilities moved to different packages.
   - **Solution**: Updated imports for utilities like `defineStyleConfig` to import from their new locations.
```

## Update for Best Practices in npm-upgrades.mdx

Add this entry under "Best Practices for NPM Updates":

```markdown
8. **Breaking API Changes**: When a package has undergone significant API changes, create thorough documentation of the required changes before attempting the migration. This preparation was key to the successful Chakra UI v3 migration.
```

## Update for Current Status and Recommendations in npm-upgrades.mdx

Update the "Current Status and Recommendations" section:

```markdown
1. **Completed Upgrades**:

   - ✅ Next.js ecosystem (Next.js, eslint-config-next, React) upgraded to latest versions
   - ✅ ESLint upgraded from v8 to v9
   - ✅ remark-slug replaced with rehype-slug
   - ✅ Chakra UI upgraded from v2 to v3
   - ✅ framer-motion upgraded from v11 to v12

2. **Future Considerations**:
   - Monitor for any styling or rendering issues related to the Chakra UI v3 upgrade
   - Continue to keep dependencies updated as new versions are released
   - Consider migrating to other modern styling solutions if Chakra UI development slows
```
