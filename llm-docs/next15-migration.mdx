# Next.js 15 Migration Guide

This document outlines the steps taken to upgrade the jessechen.net project from Next.js 14 to Next.js 15, as well as the related React ecosystem updates.

## Packages Updated

The following packages were updated as part of the migration:

- `next`: v14.2.5 → v15.x
- `eslint-config-next`: v14.2.5 → v15.x
- `react`: v18.3.1 → v19.x (optional)
- `react-dom`: v18.3.1 → v19.x (optional)

## Upgrade Steps

### 1. Package Installation

```bash
# Update Next.js and related packages
npm install next@latest eslint-config-next@latest

# Update React (optional)
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

### 2. Link API Migration

Next.js 15 removes support for the legacy Link API. We updated all instances of the Link component to use the modern API by:

1. Changing imports from `NextLink` to `Link`:

   ```jsx
   // Before
   import NextLink from "next/link"

   // After
   import Link from "next/link"
   ```

2. Removing `passHref` and `legacyBehavior` props:

   ```jsx
   // Before
   <NextLink href="/path" passHref legacyBehavior>
     <ChakraLink>Link Text</ChakraLink>
   </NextLink>

   // After
   <Link href="/path">
     <ChakraLink>Link Text</ChakraLink>
   </Link>
   ```

The following files were updated:

- `pages/posts/[...slug].js`
- `components/PostListItem.js`
- `utils/mdxComponents.js`

### 3. Fixing Hydration Errors

After the initial migration, we encountered hydration errors related to nested anchor tags. In Next.js 15, the Link component renders as an `<a>` tag by default, so nesting a ChakraLink (which is also an `<a>` tag) inside it resulted in invalid HTML.

We fixed these issues by:

1. Replacing nested Link and ChakraLink components with a single Link component using inline styles:

   ```jsx
   // Before (post-migration, causing hydration error)
   <Link href="/path">
     <ChakraLink color={linkColor}>
       Link Text
     </ChakraLink>
   </Link>

   // After (fixed)
   <Link
     href="/path"
     style={{ color: linkColor }}
   >
     Link Text
   </Link>
   ```

The following files were updated again to fix these issues:

- `pages/posts/[...slug].js` - Navigation links
- `components/PostListItem.js` - Post title links
- `utils/mdxComponents.js` - Custom link component

### 4. MDX Processing

The project uses `next-mdx-remote` for MDX processing, which is already at v5.0.0 and compatible with Next.js 15. No changes were needed for MDX processing.

### 5. Pages Router

This project uses the Pages Router pattern, not the App Router. Next.js 15 continues to support the Pages Router, so no migration to App Router was necessary.

## Potential Issues and Considerations

### Peer Dependencies

During the update process, several peer dependency warnings were encountered. These are primarily related to the Next.js and React version requirements of various packages:

- `next@14.2.24` expects `react@^18.2.0` and `react-dom@^18.2.0`
- When updating to React 19, these peer dependency warnings may appear but are generally not problematic

### Build and Deployment

After completing the migration, make sure to:

1. Run a full build to verify no build-time errors:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Test the site locally:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. Verify all key functionality:
   - Navigation links work correctly
   - MDX content renders properly
   - Dynamic routes function as expected
   - No console errors appear
