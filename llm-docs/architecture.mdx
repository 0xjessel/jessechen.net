# jessechen.net Architecture Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the jessechen.net website architecture, designed to help AI agents quickly understand the codebase structure, development workflow, and key integration points.

## Tech Stack Overview

The website is built using a modern React-based tech stack:

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **UI Framework**: Chakra UI
- **Content Format**: MDX (Markdown + JSX)
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary (for Instagram photos)
- **Additional Services**: Instagram API integration

```

## Key Components

### 1. Content Management

- Blog posts are written in MDX format
- Posts are stored in `posts/YYYY/title-here.mdx`
- Each post requires specific frontmatter metadata:
  ```md
  ---
  title: "Post Title"
  description: "Post description"
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  isPublished: boolean
  tags: string[]
  coverImage: string
  ---
  ```

### 2. MDX Processing and Rendering

The website uses a sophisticated pipeline to transform MDX files into interactive blog posts:

#### MDX File Processing Flow:

1. **Static Generation**:

   - Next.js `getStaticPaths` identifies all MDX files during build
   - Paths are generated from the directory structure (e.g., `posts/2022/post-title.mdx` becomes `/posts/2022/post-title`)

2. **Content Extraction and Parsing**:

   - `gray-matter` extracts frontmatter metadata and content
   - Metadata includes title, description, date, tags, etc.
   - `reading-time` calculates estimated reading time

3. **MDX Compilation**:

   - Raw MDX is processed using `next-mdx-remote/serialize`
   - Uses remark plugins (`remark-breaks`, `remark-slug`) for Markdown enhancements
   - Uses rehype plugins (`MDXPrism`) for syntax highlighting
   - Serialized MDX becomes executable React components

4. **Component Rendering System**:
   - Custom components defined in `utils/mdxComponents.js` replace standard HTML tags
   - Custom components use Chakra UI styling for consistent design
   - Special components include:
     - `Heading` with auto-generated anchor links
     - `GIF` for video handling
     - `Callout` for highlighted information
     - Enhanced code blocks with syntax highlighting

#### Custom React Components in MDX

MDX allows embedding custom React components directly in Markdown content. The process works as follows:

1. **Component Definition and Mapping**:

   - Custom components are defined in `utils/mdxComponents.js`
   - The `components` object maps HTML elements to custom React components:

   ```javascript
   export const components = {
     h1: (p) => <Heading as="h1" fontSize="2xl" {...p} />,
     h2: (p) => <Heading as="h2" fontSize="xl" {...p} />,
     p: (p) => <Text as="p" mb="8" {...p} />,
     // Additional component mappings
     GIF: (p) => <GIF my="8" {...p} />,
     Callout: (p) => <Callout mb="8" {...p} />,
   }
   ```

2. **Using Components in MDX Files**:

   - Standard Markdown elements (headings, paragraphs) are automatically mapped
   - Custom components are used with JSX syntax in the MDX file:

   ```mdx
   # This is a heading (maps to h1 component)

   This is a paragraph (maps to p component)

   <Callout type="info">This uses the custom Callout component</Callout>

   <GIF>
     <source src="/videos/example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
   </GIF>
   ```

3. **Component Rehydration**:

   - During build time, MDX content is parsed and transformed into React element descriptions
   - At runtime, `MDXRemote` rehydrates these descriptions into actual React components
   - The `components` prop provides the mapping of component names to their implementations:

   ```javascript
   <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
   ```

4. **Prop Passing**:

   - Props can be passed to components in MDX using standard JSX syntax
   - Props flow through to the underlying React components
   - Components receive children as a standard React prop

5. **Scoped Data Access**:
   - The `scope` option in serialization makes frontmatter data available to MDX components
   - Custom components can access this data through the global scope within MDX content
   ```javascript
   const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
     // ...
     scope: data, // Makes frontmatter data available in MDX
   })
   ```

This approach allows for rich, interactive content while maintaining the simplicity of Markdown for basic text formatting.

#### Technical Implementation:

```javascript
// Dynamic path handling in Next.js (pages/posts/[...slug].js)
export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  // Load the MDX file from the filesystem
  const postFilename = `${params.slug.join('/')}.mdx`
  const source = fs.readFileSync(path.join(POSTS_PATH, postFilename))

  // Parse frontmatter and content
  const { content, data } = matter(source)

  // Calculate reading time
  data.readingTime = require('reading-time')(content)

  // Serialize MDX content for rendering
  const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
    mdxOptions: {
      remarkPlugins: [remarkBreaks, remarkSlug],
      rehypePlugins: [MDXPrism],
    },
    scope: data,
  })

  return {
    props: { source: mdxSource, frontMatter: data, ... }
  }
}

// In the page component:
export default function PostPage({ source, frontMatter }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Heading>{frontMatter.title}</Heading>
      <PostMetadata frontMatter={frontMatter} />
      {/* MDX content rendered with custom components */}
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

5. **Page Navigation**:
   - Previous/next post links are generated by sorting posts chronologically
   - Index pages (`/posts`) list all published posts with metadata summaries
   - Posts are automatically excluded if `isPublished` is set to `false`

### 3. Instagram Integration

The site features an Instagram photo grid with an automated sync system:

#### Architecture Flow:

1. Access token management:

   - Monthly token refresh via `ig_access_token.py`
   - Tokens stored in Vercel environment variables
   - Backup token storage on Dreamhost

2. Photo synchronization:
   - Daily cron job runs at midnight
   - `ig_fetch.py` fetches latest 9 photos
   - Photos are synchronized with Cloudinary
   - Integration points:
     - Instagram API (`/{user_id}/media` endpoint)
     - Cloudinary storage
     - Dreamhost for script hosting

### 3. Development Workflow

#### Local Development:

```bash
# Installation
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev        # Starts at http://localhost:3000
```

#### Content Creation Process:

1. Write content in Notion
2. Export to Markdown
3. Convert to MDX format
4. Add required metadata
5. Place in `posts/YYYY/` directory
6. Add images to `public/images/posts/YYYY/`
7. Update image paths in MDX
8. Test locally
9. Deploy via git push

## Environment Configuration

The application requires several environment variables:

- Instagram API credentials
- Cloudinary configuration
- Other service integrations

Environment files:

- `.env.local` - Local development
- `.env.default` - Template for required variables
- Production variables set in Vercel dashboard

## Deployment

- Main deployment: Vercel (automatic on main branch push)
- Secondary services: Dreamhost (for cron jobs and scripts)
- Content delivery: Cloudinary (for Instagram photos)

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Blog Posts

1. Create new MDX file in `posts/YYYY/`
2. Add required frontmatter
3. Add images to `public/images/posts/YYYY/`
4. Reference images using path: `/images/posts/YYYY/image-name.png`
5. Test locally before deploying

### Modifying UI Components

- Components are located in `components/` directory
- Uses Chakra UI for styling and components
- Follows React best practices
- Changes automatically hot-reload in development

### Debugging Tips

1. Instagram Integration:
   - Check Dreamhost cron logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Test token refresh manually
2. Content Issues:
   - Verify MDX frontmatter format
   - Check image paths
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

## Performance Considerations

- Next.js provides automatic code splitting
- Images should be optimized before upload
- Instagram photos are cached in Cloudinary
- MDX content is statically generated at build time

## Security Notes

- Instagram access tokens must be kept secure
- Environment variables should never be committed
- API keys should be rotated periodically
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

## Future AI Development Guidelines

When working with this codebase, AI agents should:

1. Respect the existing architecture patterns
2. Maintain the MDX content structure
3. Follow the established component organization
4. Use Chakra UI for new components
5. Test Instagram integration changes carefully
6. Keep security considerations in mind
7. Document any architectural changes in this file
