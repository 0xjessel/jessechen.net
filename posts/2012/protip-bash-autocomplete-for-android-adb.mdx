### Introduction

This is a super quick tip that will only take 1 minute to make your android development so much easier.  Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a command-line tool that lets you interface with an emulator or an android device.  Its great and previously I wrote about how you can [debug your Android app wirelessly on your device](http://www.jessechen.net/blog/debugging-your-android-app-wirelessly-on-an-android-smartphone/).  What sucks though is that you can't tab autocomplete commands (e.g. type `adb d` then tab and bash will autocomplete and fill out `adb devices`), which means having to look up adb commands to figure out what you want and/or wasting time by typing the whole command (every ms counts!).

This protip will get you setup with bash autocomplete for ADB in less than 1 minute.  Ready?  Here we go.

### Instructions

- Download the adb bash completion file [here](http://romannurik-code.googlecode.com/git/misc/bash_completion/adb) from Roman's repo.  Another good one is here on [github](https://github.com/mbrubeck/android-completion/blob/master/android) by mbrubeck.
- Store the file somewhere safe.  Anywhere you want. I chose /bin.
- Use your favorite editor of choice (which should be vim) to edit your ~/.bashrc file.
- Add the following lines (substitute your **own path** to the adb bash completion file) to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

```bash
if \[ -e /bin/adb.txt \] ; then source /bin/adb.txt fi
```

- Save and quit.  In your terminal, type `source ~/.bashrc` to reload your bash.
- Check if it works.  Type 'adb d' and press tab to see if it autocompletes to 'adb devices'.

And that's it!  I've been looking for something like this for a long time.  Hope it helps you as much as it did for me. :)
