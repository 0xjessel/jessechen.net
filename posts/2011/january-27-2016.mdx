One year ago, I purchased this domain.  I was just a sophomore at UC Berkeley - on January 27, 2010, I was reading my Google Reader subscriptions (as usual) and I stumbled on a deal -  1 year domain name registration for only 1.17$!

So much has happened since then.  I decided to go ahead and renew it for another five years.  Thinking about how my domain is designated to expire on 1/27/2016 makes me really think about what the hell am I going to be doing in half a decade.  I will be 25 years, the prime of my life.  Will I be working at a place I look forward to working every single day?  Will I decide to leave everything behind and travel the world?  Is there going to be a catastrophic natural disaster that is going to destroy the entire world?  Am I going to be a soldier in WWIII?  (Ok, now I'm just going paranoid)

Think about yourself now, and ask yourself what do you think you will be doing in five years.

The future is promised to no one.  Make the present count.
