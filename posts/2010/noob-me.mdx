So I created my [domain](http://jessechen.net) a while ago, but I have no experience in developing webpages or administering a web server.

My goal is to figure it out so I can have an attractive \[or at least semi-decent\] web page where it can be a central hub for myself online.  Perhaps have a place where I can display some of my outstanding projects/work that I have done so far, and be a way for people to look up more info about me.  How does that sound?  I think it sounds AWESOME.

As for this blog, it will just be something I'll write on for fun sometimes.  I'm still trying to get over that uncomfortable feeling of the fact that people I know and likewise, people I do not know, are reading "my blog".  \*rolls eyes\*
