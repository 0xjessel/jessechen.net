### Quadrant Standard Benchmark

In this video, I ran the Quadrant Benchmark test on both the Motorola Droid and the Droid X at the same time.  The Quadrant Standard benchmark tests the CPU/GPU by conducting a variety of arithmetic that stress the CPU, memory throughput tests, I/O database read/writes, and running short graphic animations to see how many FPS the device can handle.  In the end, the data is sent to their servers and a score is calculated based off all those tests.  They show your device's score compared to other devices in a bar graph to see how your device pits against others.  In my tests, the Motorola Droid that is running at the standard 600MHz, android 2.2 froyo scored 874, which is just above the average score for a Samsung Galaxy S running 2.1 eclair.  The average score for a Droid running 2.1 is really low in the charts, scoring 2nd to the bottom so one can see the drastic boost in speed that an android device gets when it updates from 2.1 to 2.2, because of the JIT compiler that is introduced in 2.2.

The Droid X, however, scored a whopping 1263 in this video, and that is just shy of a Nexus One running 2.2.  So, although the Droid X is running 2.1 eclair, the 1GHz OMAP 3630 processor is super fast.  One can only imagine how well the Droid X will score when it is updated to 2.2.  It will be off the charts, literally.

### Linpack for Android

Linpack for Android benchmarks your smartphone by calculating how many megaflops it can calculate in a given amount of time.  I ran a series of 5 tests to get a better understanding on how each device stands compared to each other.

Droid: 9.129 | Droid X: 8.328

Droid: 9.632 | Droid X: 8.328

Droid: 9.598 | Droid X: 8.315

Droid: 9.615 | Droid X: 7.834

Droid: 9.598 | Droid X: 8.328

As you can see, the Droid consistently calculated more megaflops than the Droid X.  So surprisingly, in this benchmark, the Droid takes the cake and goes home with the money.  I can guess that this is a test purely stressing the CPU, which makes it more even for the Droid.  However, if it was that simple, the Droid X should have easily won because it's processor is 1.6x faster than the Droid.  Do keep in mind, though, that the Droid has a JIT compiler, which somehow plays into this benchmark, making it compute megaflops faster :P  I wish I can explain the details in whole, but unfortunately, I don't really know much more than that.

I will update with another video when the Droid X gets 2.2 froyo, and then we'll see how it pits against the Motorola Droid.
