### Droid X

I got my DROID X yesterday from my pre-order at Best Buy.  Played with the phone for about a day now and I got to say that it is a really solid phone.  I'm glad I got it and I promised my friend, Jeff, to write a short review/my impressions on it.  As a matter of fact, I'm on BART right now en route to Berkeley typing this on my Macbook.  How?  The Macbook is tethered to my DROID X :) I hope that those 1337 android devs can hack this phone and make it more awesome.  It is quite disappointing that Motorola encrypted the bootloader - but I don't really use custom ROMs anyway, however, not being able to modify the kernel so I can {over | under}clock my phone is sad.  Root would be all I need though.

### Basketball

Heading to Berkeley right now was a spur-of-the-moment decision to play some ball with some friends because I haven't played basketball for so long.  The past two weeks I haven't been able to play and its making me itching to play.  I don't know how to describe it but day and night I feel like I have to run, dribble, shoot, pass.  It's ridiculous - it's taking over my body, just can't get my mind off of it.
