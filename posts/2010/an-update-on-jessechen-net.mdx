This is how my website first looked:

![Look how 90's looking my website used to look like](/images/posts/2010/my-first-web-page.png)
_I feel like I was transported back into the Internet 10 years ago just by looking at this site_

4 days later, it now looks like this:

![Looks better, right?](/images/posts/2010/jessechen-net-v03.png)
_I bet if you click this, the website already looks different_

It is amazing how different it looks.  However, I take no credit - I must thank [Dreamweaver](http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/) for this.  Even the most clueless person can make a tolerable website \[like myself\] through Dreamweaver.  The product itself is really nice, it hides the many layers of abstraction that it takes to create a good-looking website.  One feature I really enjoy is the dual-pane view of both the code and the design of the site at the same time.  That way, I am also learning HTML and CSS by interacting with the code and seeing the effects in real time.

I want to say that my website is at version 0.3 with a big **beta** sticker over it like Google does with all their products :P. It is by no means complete but I look forward to working on it.  fosho.

### Things to Try/Do on my website:

1. Add an interactive timeline for my work history
2. Include a place to display some of my school projects/work
3. Add a subdomain where I can display some of my pictures in a gallery.
4. Incorporate my LinkedIn profile via their API
5. Incorpoate my Facebook profile via their API
6. Any other sites I can use their API for?
7. Continue to make it look more presentable
