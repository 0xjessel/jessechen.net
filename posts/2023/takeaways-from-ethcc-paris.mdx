Angular forms are a fundamental part of building interactive web applications. They allow users to input and submit data while providing validation and user experience enhancements. In Angular, there are several key classes and concepts that form the foundation of working with forms: `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, `FormBuilder`, and `FormArray`. Let's explore each of these in detail and understand their purposes and use cases.

## `FormControl`

The `FormControl` class represents an individual input element within a form. It encapsulates the value, validation state, and user interactions for that specific input. It's commonly used for simple form controls like text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

### Usage

```typescript
import { FormControl, Validators } from '@angular/forms';

const username = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
const email = new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.email]);
