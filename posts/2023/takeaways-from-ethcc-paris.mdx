Angular forms are a fundamental part of building interactive web applications. They allow users to input and submit data while providing validation and user experience enhancements. In Angular, there are several key classes and concepts that form the foundation of working with forms: `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, `FormBuilder`, and `FormArray`. Let's explore each of these in detail and understand their purposes and use cases.

## `FormControl`

The `FormControl` class represents an individual input element within a form. It encapsulates the value, validation state, and user interactions for that specific input. It's commonly used for simple form controls like text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

### Usage

```typescript
| Feature           | `FormControl`                      | `FormGroup`                         | `FormBuilder`                      | `FormArray`                       |

| Purpose           | Represents an individual input    | Represents a group of related     | Simplifies form creation          | Represents an array of form controls |
|                   | element                           | form controls                      |                                   |                                 |
| Usage             | Used for simple form controls     | Used for complex forms with        | Used to simplify form creation    | Used to manage an array of form controls |

| Nested Controls   | Cannot hold other controls       | Can hold other controls            | Can hold other controls           | Can hold other controls           |
| Nesting           | Cannot nest `FormGroup` or        | Can nest other `FormGroup` or      | Can nest other `FormGroup` or     | Can nest other controls, including |
|                   | `FormArray`                        | `FormArray`                         | `FormArray`                        | other `FormArray` instances       |
